## 👋 Hi, I'm Natalie Harper

I'm a software engineer with a focus on driver validation and low-level systems. Most of my experience comes from working at Intel, where I specialized in power and performance validation using C++ and Python.

I was also part of Intel’s SWIFT (Software Improvement Facilitated Training) program, helping engineers across the company improve code quality through shared terminology, clean coding practices, and design patterns.

### 🛠️ Tech I enjoy working with:
- C++, Python, shell scripting
- Low-level systems & hardware validation
- Performance testing, tools, and automation

### 🌱 Always learning more about:
- Clean architecture & software design
- Cross-functional engineering practices
- Developer tools & infrastructure

### 🐾 Fun fact:
Outside of code, I love animals (currently raising 2 dogs, a cat, 2 fish tanks, and a tortoise), gaming, and exploring new hobbies.
